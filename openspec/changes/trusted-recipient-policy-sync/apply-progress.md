# Apply Progress: trusted-recipient-policy-sync

Cumulative. Each entry is a completed work unit with its verification evidence. Later
slices append; earlier entries are never rewritten.

## Delivery context

- Worktree: `/Users/ramiro/Desktop/projects/colloseum.feat-solana-operational`, branch
  `feat/solana-operational`.
- Review Workload Forecast: `Decision needed before apply: Yes`, `Chained PRs
  recommended: Yes`, `400-line budget risk: High` (whole-change estimate ~12,000–16,000
  lines, re-measured at apply).
- Resolved delivery path for this work unit: parent-assigned **single work unit inside
  the chained slice 1** (`PR 1` = tasks 1.1–1.3, bounded outcome "Schema, lease,
  repository", rollback boundary "Migration files + `src/wallet/policy/{lease,repository}.ts`").
  No `size:exception` is requested; this unit is only task 1.1 and does not attempt the
  rest of slice 1.
- `actionContext` / edit roots: all writes stayed inside the assigned worktree root. The
  main checkout and the untracked `compose.privy-local.ports.yaml` were not touched.
- Structured status consumed: native SDD status is non-authoritative for this phase
  because the parent prompt supplied the resolved work unit, the artifact paths, and the
  delivery path directly. Readiness was resolved against the OpenSpec artifacts
  (`tasks.md` slice-1 preamble, `design.md` §2.1–§2.7, `spec.md`), all present and
  approved before any edit.

## Slice 1

### Task 1.1 — add the `015` recipient-policy-sync migration with its integration proof

Status: **completed**. Persisted checkbox updated in
`openspec/changes/trusted-recipient-policy-sync/tasks.md` (`- [x]`).

#### Files changed

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/db/migrations/015_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | New. Legacy local migration path (unqualified names; the runner sets `search_path = public, extensions`). |
| `supabase/migrations/20261005000400_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | New. Supabase-chain mirror with the `public.` qualification (next free timestamp after `20261005000300_session_floor.sql`). |
| `tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts` | New. Static + database proof: object presence, DB-enforced invariants, re-run idempotency. |
| `tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts` | New. Cross-user RLS denial on all five tables, with the system-context positive control for `recipient_policy_leases`. |

#### What the unit delivers

Five additive tables per design §2.1–§2.5, plus §2.6 RLS/grants/FKs and the
`grant_audit_log`-style append-only guard:

- `recipient_policy_state` — desired vs. applied revision, `applied_rules_hash` as a
  distinct authoritative rule hash (design §0 C6), consent baseline/provenance, verifiable
  status, `recipient_policy_state_revision_order_ck` (`applied_revision <= desired_revision`)
  and `recipient_policy_state_applied_complete_ck` (an `applied` status must carry the
  whole evidence set), plus `user_idx` and the partial `retry_idx`.
- `recipient_policy_sync_intent` — durable desired intent with `composed_rules`/`composed_hash`,
  unique `(wallet_id, desired_revision)`, the one-in-flight partial unique index, the
  idempotency partial unique index, and the due-scan partial index.
- `contact_action_proposals` — immutable versioned proposals with `revoked_grant_ids`,
  one-open-per-conversation partial unique index, immutable `(user_id, id, version)`
  unique index and the open-scan index.
- `recipient_policy_leases` — one holder per wallet (`wallet_id` PK),
  `desired_revision_at_acquire` recorded, system-only RLS. The three lease functions are
  deliberately **not** in this unit; task 1.2 appends them.
- `recipient_policy_audit` — append-only evidence with the full 16-event vocabulary and a
  `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` guard trigger.

Also: `ENABLE` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all five tables; owner-isolation policies on
state/intent/audit/proposals; `recipient_policy_sync_intent_system_access` for the
reconciler scan; `recipient_policy_leases_system_only`; `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC` plus
`SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` (state/intent/proposals), `SELECT, INSERT` (audit) and
`SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` (leases) to `recipient_app`; thirteen
`IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint …)` + `NOT VALID` foreign keys.

Additive only: no `DROP TABLE`/`DROP COLUMN`/`DROP CONSTRAINT`/`DROP INDEX`, no
`ALTER COLUMN … TYPE`. Only `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` and `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` appear,
which is the re-appliability pattern of `008_delegated_grants.sql`.

#### TDD Cycle Evidence

| Phase | Evidence |
|---|---|
| RED | Both suites written first and run against the un-migrated database: **22 failed / 2 passed (24)**. Failures were `relation "…" does not exist` for every schema object and the invariant tests. The two "passes" were `expect(...).rejects.toThrow()` assertions satisfied by the *missing relation*, i.e. false greens. |
| RED cleanup | Both false greens were replaced with an explicit positive control executed **before** the negative assertion. Re-run confirmed the honest RED state (the positive control cannot pass against a missing table). |
| GREEN | Supabase mirror applied to this worktree's database (`docker compose exec -T db psql … < supabase/migrations/20261005000400_recipient_policy_sync.sql`), then **24 passed / 24**. |
| TRIANGULATE | Added after GREEN: the one-open-proposal rule is proven scoped, not global — a second conversation's proposal is accepted while the first is open, and consuming the open one frees the slot for a new version. Both falsifiable directions of `applied_complete_ck`, the revision-order CHECK, the in-flight index, the idempotency index and the append-only trigger already carry accept + reject pairs. |
| REFACTOR | None needed. `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` clean; no production code touched, so no refactor surface exists. |

#### Commands run and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts` (RED, pre-migration) | 22 failed / 2 passed (24) — expected RED |
| `docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d wdk_agent -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < supabase/migrations/20261005000400_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | applied; only benign `already exists, skipping` notices on the second and third runs |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts` | **2 files passed, 24 tests passed** |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/session-floor-migration.test.ts tests/integration/delegated-grants-schema.test.ts tests/integration/notifications-schema.test.ts tests/integration/privy-policy-admin-migration.test.ts` | **4 files passed, 23 tests passed** — includes the real-chain `runMigrations` suite, which rebuilds a fresh database from `src/db/migrations/` and therefore proves the unqualified `015` file applies through the legacy runner |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/*migration*.test.ts tests/integration/*schema*.test.ts` | **6 files passed, 47 tests passed** |
| `npm run lint` | clean (`eslint src tests --max-warnings=0`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | clean (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`) |

#### Deviations from the design

Two, both deliberate and additive:

1. **The self-referencing FK name is shorter than the table name would imply.**
   `contact_action_proposals_supersedes_id_contact_action_proposals_fk` is 69 characters,
   and Postgres silently truncates identifiers to 63. That truncation is not cosmetic: the
   `IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname = …)` guard compares the
   *untruncated* name, so a re-apply would not find the stored constraint and would fail
   with a duplicate-constraint error. The constraint is therefore named
   `contact_action_proposals_supersedes_id_proposals_fk` (51 chars), matching the existing
   `…_grant_id_grants_fk` nickname style. Every identifier in the migration is now ≤53
   characters (checked directly against `pg_constraint`/`pg_class`/`pg_policies`/`pg_trigger`).
2. **Inline CHECK constraints carry explicit `_ck` names** (e.g.
   `recipient_policy_state_status_ck`) instead of the Postgres-generated
   `<table>_<column>_check`. Design §2 shows them unnamed; naming them follows
   `008_delegated_grants.sql` (`grant_claim_ledger_amount_positive_ck`) and makes each CHECK
   assertable by name. No CHECK from design §2 was dropped or weakened.

#### Observations handed to later tasks (not defects in this unit)

- Design §2.6 grants the reconciler's anonymous system context a policy only on
  `recipient_policy_sync_intent`. If slice 2 ever appends `recipient_policy_audit` rows
  from a system transaction (e.g. the `lease_reclaimed` audit of §5.2 step 3) outside a
  user transaction, that write will be denied by RLS and slice 2 must add the matching
  system-access policy. Recorded here rather than pre-emptively added, because the design
  is authoritative for this schema and adding authority the design does not describe would
  itself be drift.
- The local database was built the CI way, so `src/db/migrations` is not what it reflects.
  The Supabase mirror is what was applied; `npm run db:migrate` does not read `.env` in
  this worktree and was not used.

#### Remaining tasks in slice 1

```text
- [ ] **1.2 Add the lease functions and the lease API.**
- [ ] **1.3 Add the `recipient_policy_sync` repository.**
- [ ] **1.4 Build the pure composer and prove the composition invariants in unit tests.**
- [ ] **1.5 Implement the readback comparator as a pure function with its failure classes.**
- [ ] **1.6 Add `RecipientPolicyService` with server-owned identity, wallet, and network, plus the strict service-seam types.**
- [ ] **1.7 Implement the atomic removal transaction with whole-grant revocation.**
- [ ] **1.8 Delete the legacy full-rule writer entry points and route their callers through the composer.**
- [ ] **1.9 Document and install the single lock order, prepending `W0` to the claim path.**
- [ ] **1.10 Extend the structural guard suite to make a second full-rule writer unreachable by construction.**
- [ ] **1.11 Run the slice-1 gate and record the slice-1 work-unit commits.**
```

#### Workload / PR boundary

One commit, one work unit: the `015` migration in both file forms plus the two integration
suites that prove it. It is an honest single PR-1 slice boundary per the forecast table
(`PR 1` rollback boundary begins at the migration files). No push, no PR.

### Task 1.2 — add the lease functions and the lease API

Status: **completed**. Persisted checkbox updated in
`openspec/changes/trusted-recipient-policy-sync/tasks.md` (`- [x]`).

#### Files changed

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/db/migrations/015_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | Appended: the three lease functions plus one SELECT-only system-read policy (see deviations). Header updated to `(tasks 1.1, 1.2)`. |
| `supabase/migrations/20261005000400_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | Same block, `public.`-qualified. `diff <(sed 's/public\.//g' mirror) leaf` shows only the header comment (the 1.1 convention). |
| `src/wallet/policy/lease.ts` | New. `acquirePolicyLease` / `renewPolicyLease` / `releasePolicyLease` + the §1.4 constants. |
| `tests/integration/recipient-policy-lease.test.ts` | New. 10 cases; every database case drives **two real `createDatabaseClient` pools**, so contention is a real row conflict, not a simulated lock. |

#### What the unit delivers

- **SQL (design §1.4/§2.4).** `acquire_recipient_policy_lease(p_wallet_id, p_user_id,
  p_owner_id, p_lease_seconds = 60)` mirrors `acquire_reconciliation_lease`
  (`013_wallet_notifications.sql:106-160`): delete-expired, then `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
  (wallet_id) DO UPDATE … WHERE existing.expires_at <= now()`, table-qualified column
  references inside the `RETURNS TABLE (lease_token)` OUT-variable trap, `md5(random() ||
  clock_timestamp() || p_owner_id)` token, no `SECURITY DEFINER`. It records
  `desired_revision_at_acquire` from `recipient_policy_state` (0 when no state row exists).
  `renew_…` and `release_…` are token-guarded and return a boolean (row count), so a stale
  holder learns it lost the lease. Renewal enforces the 300 s hard hold ceiling inside the
  function that owns the row.
- **TS API (design §1.4).** Bounded wait on the documented `100 ms × 2^n` schedule capped
  at 1 s, `waitBudgetMs` default 3 000, and the sleep is clamped to the remaining budget so
  the budget is never overshot. `busy` on exhaustion, `unavailable` when the database is
  unreachable (never a fabricated acquisition), `false` from renew on any failure (fail
  closed). Published constants: TTL 60 s, renewal cadence 10 s, hard hold 300 s.
- **No new index/constraint.** Both the expiry sweep and the token-guarded renew/release are
  `wallet_id` PK lookups, and §1.4/§2.4 define no other access path, so 1.1's schema already
  covers the lease semantics. The one object 1.1 did not create and §1.4 requires is the
  system-context read of `recipient_policy_state` (deviation 1).

#### TDD Cycle Evidence

| Phase | Evidence |
|---|---|
| RED (module) | Suite written first and run before `lease.ts` existed: **0 tests run**, `Cannot find module '../../src/wallet/policy/lease.js'`. |
| RED (SQL) | `lease.ts` added, database still un-migrated: **6 failed / 4 passed (10)**. Every database case failed with `acquire_… does not exist` (surfacing honestly as `unavailable`/`false`), i.e. absent behaviour, not a tolerated green. The 4 passes were the three stub-driven cases (schedule, zero budget, unreachable database) and the constants contract — none of which touch the database. |
| RED (RLS) | Migration applied **without** the system-read policy: **1 failed / 9 passed**. The one failure was exactly `expected '0' to be '7'` for `desired_revision_at_acquire`, proving the policy is load-bearing rather than decorative; the planned deviation was then justified by observed behaviour, not by argument. |
| GREEN | Policy added to both files and applied: **10 passed / 10**. |
| TRIANGULATE | Two directional pairs added after GREEN: (a) the recorded revision stays `7` after `desired_revision` is bumped to `9`, and a wallet with no state row records `0` — so `7` comes from the row and not from a constant; (b) at `acquired_at = now() - 299 s` the same token still renews while at `- 301 s` it refuses, so the refusal is the documented 300 s boundary rather than “any elapsed time”. The reclaim pair already asserts the false direction (stale renew) **and** the true direction (reclaimer's renew) on the same wallet. |
| REFACTOR | `PolicyLeaseRef` initially carried a redundant `walletId` (caught by `npm run typecheck`, not by the runtime suite). Removed; no behaviour change. Lint and typecheck clean afterwards. |
| False-green guard | Every negative assertion has a preceding positive control: the owner reads `desired_revision = 7` before the lease diagnostic is asserted; the live-token renew is asserted `true` before the stale-token renew is asserted `false`; the real-token release deletes the row before the foreign-token release is asserted to be a no-op. |

#### Commands run and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-lease.test.ts` (RED, module absent; RED, SQL absent; RED, policy absent; GREEN) | 0 tests (module), then **6 failed / 4 passed**, then **1 failed / 9 passed**, then **10 passed / 10** |
| `docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d wdk_agent -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < supabase/migrations/20261005000400_recipient_policy_sync.sql` | applied; re-applied three further times with **0** error lines (only benign `already exists, skipping` notices), so the 1.1 suites' re-apply stays safe |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-lease.test.ts` | **1 file passed, 10 tests passed** (2.2 s) |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts` | **2 files passed, 24 tests passed** — the 1.1 suites stayed green, including the mirror↔local content-equivalence check |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-lease.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts` | **3 files passed, 34 tests passed** |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/privy-policy-admin-migration.test.ts` | **1 file passed, 4 tests passed** — the real-chain suite rebuilds a fresh database from `src/db/migrations/`, proving the unqualified `015` (functions + policy) applies through the legacy runner |
| `npm run lint` | clean (`eslint src tests --max-warnings=0`, exit 0) |
| `npm run typecheck` | clean (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`, exit 0) |
| `npx vitest run` (whole suite, twice) | Pre-existing noise only. Baseline method: the same 13 affected files were run with 1.2's SQL reverted to `HEAD` and with it restored. **Baseline: 5 failures — 5 failed / 79 passed.** **With 1.2: the same 5 by name, plus one 15 s timing failure** (`notifications-webhook-deep` “returns the same 404 for a foreign conversation as for a missing one”) that **passes in isolation on the changed tree (2 consecutive runs, 14/14)** and is DB-load flakiness, not a regression. No `recipient-policy-*` suite failed in either state. |
| Identifier length audit (`pg_proc` / `pg_policies`) | Longest new name is `recipient_policy_state_system_read` (34); functions 28–30. Well inside the 63-char truncation limit that bit 1.1, so the re-apply guards stay effective. |

#### Deviations from the design

Three, all deliberate and additive:

1. **Added a SELECT-only system-read policy on `recipient_policy_state`**
   (`recipient_policy_state_system_read`). §1.4 requires `acquire` to read
   `desired_revision` “from `recipient_policy_state` inside acquire” while running in
   `withSystemTransaction` (no `app.user_id`), and §2.6 grants the anonymous context a policy
   only on the intent table. With the design's schema as written, that read returns zero rows
   and the new diagnostic column would silently always report `0`. Proved by the RED (RLS)
   run above (`'0'` ≠ `'7'`), not by argument. SELECT only: no write authority is added,
   owner isolation on that table is unchanged, and the design's §5.2 reconciler needs exactly
   this read in slice 2 anyway. Flagged for task 2.9.
2. **`renew_recipient_policy_lease` takes a fourth defaulted parameter**
   (`p_max_hold_seconds INTEGER DEFAULT 300`) so the 300 s hard hold ceiling is enforced by
   the authority that owns the row. §2.4 shows a three-parameter signature; the extra
   parameter is defaulted, so the documented call shape is unchanged. A caller-side-only
   ceiling would be bypassable by any other process and untestable at the database level.
3. **Optional injected `now` / `sleep` (and `leaseSeconds` / `maxHoldSeconds`) on the API.**
   The design's `deps` shape is preserved; the injections exist so the published backoff
   schedule is asserted deterministically (`[100, 200, 400, 800, …]`, capped at 1 000, total
   wait exactly the budget) instead of by wall-clock timing, and so a test can request a 1 s
   TTL and observe a real expiry reclaim instead of back-dating the row.

Two smaller, non-behavioural choices: the lease functions are appended in a labelled
“Task 1.2” section (rather than beside the table 1.1 declared) so every task in this slice
keeps a purely additive diff; and the two file headers now read `(tasks 1.1, 1.2)`.

#### Observations handed to later tasks (not defects in this unit)

- **`recipient_policy_audit` is still owner-only.** This unit appends no audit rows, so it
  needs no change; the `lease_acquired` / `lease_reclaimed` appends of §5.2 step 3 will be
  RLS-denied from a system transaction unless slice 2 adds the matching system-access policy.
  The carried-over note from 1.1 stands unchanged.
- The 300 s ceiling is enforced as `acquired_at > now() - 300 s` on renew. A holder renewing
  at 295 s therefore gets an `expires_at` up to one TTL past the ceiling. That is intentional:
  the ceiling bounds *renewal*, not expiry, and the caller's contract on `false` is
  release-then-re-acquire.

#### Remaining tasks in slice 1

```text
- [ ] **1.3 Add the `recipient_policy_sync` repository.**
- [ ] **1.4 Build the pure composer and prove the composition invariants in unit tests.**
- [ ] **1.5 Implement the readback comparator as a pure function with its failure classes.**

- [ ] **1.11 Run the slice-1 gate and record the slice-1 work-unit commits.**
```

#### Workload / PR boundary

One commit, one work unit: the three lease functions plus one policy in both migration file
forms, `src/wallet/policy/lease.ts`, and the integration suite that proves them. It sits inside
the assigned `PR 1` slice (tasks 1.1–1.3, rollback boundary “Migration files +
`src/wallet/policy/{lease,repository}.ts`”). No `size:exception` is requested and no slice-2
work was started. No push, no PR.

#### Commit

`feat(policy): serialize wallet composition with a lease` — see the report envelope for the SHA.

### Task 1.3 — add the `recipient_policy_sync` repository

Status: **completed**. Persisted checkbox updated in
`openspec/changes/trusted-recipient-policy-sync/tasks.md` (`- [x]`).

#### Files changed

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/wallet/policy/repository.ts` | New. The typed, bind-parameterized access layer for `recipient_policy_state`, `recipient_policy_sync_intent`, `recipient_policy_audit`, `contact_action_proposals`, the composer's contact read, and the `signer_grants` projection refresh — plus the typed domain conflicts each index raises. |
| `tests/integration/recipient-policy-repository.test.ts` | New. 19 cases over two real connection pools: the §1.5 CAS, the W0 lock, the three intent indexes, exactly-once consumption under a real race, cross-user isolation on every read and write, and the authority boundary. |

#### What the unit delivers

- **`recipient_policy_state` (design §2.1, §1.5).** `readPolicyState` (owner-scoped, `null` when
  absent), `lockPolicyState` (the `W0(U)` slot: create-if-absent `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` then
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, requiring an explicit client because a lock released by the repository's own
  commit would be useless), `bumpDesiredRevision`, `commitAppliedRevision` (the exact §1.5 CAS,
  `false` ⇔ zero rows ⇔ the desired revision moved) and `setPolicyStatus` for the non-`applied`
  transitions with their bounded evidence and relative attempt bookkeeping.
- **`recipient_policy_sync_intent` (design §2.2, §5.2).** `insertIntent` (owner-scoped, one intent
  per `(wallet, desired_revision)`), `listDueIntents` + `claimIntent` (the ONLY anonymous
  system-context paths: the reconciler must enumerate due intents across wallets and resolve each
  owner from the row it reads), and `supersedeIntent` (owner-scoped, inside the caller's
  transaction so the supersede and its replacement commit together). All three unique/partial
  indexes are translated into typed errors instead of leaking a driver error.
- **Composer contact read (design §3.1).** `listComposerContacts`: active + `network='solana-devnet'`
  + the caller's own rows, with the version a mutation must echo back. `recipients.address_confirmed_at`
  is `NOT NULL` by schema, so the chain scope *is* the confirmation axis; legacy NULL-network EVM rows
  are never composed.
- **`recipient_policy_audit` (design §2.5).** `appendPolicyAudit` returns the row id, owner-scoped,
  append-only (asserted through the trigger).
- **`contact_action_proposals` (design §2.3, §4.5).** `insertProposal` (immutable versioned identity
  columns, one-open-per-conversation enforced with a typed conflict), `readProposal`, and
  `consumeProposal` — the whole predicate in one conditional `UPDATE`: id **and** version **and**
  owner **and** `status='open'` **and** `consumed_at IS NULL` **and** `expires_at > now()`.
- **`signer_grants` projection (design §5.4).** `refreshSignerGrantProjection` writes
  `allowlisted_recipients` + `policy_hash` on the wallet's newest `state='active'` row and returns
  `null` when the wallet has none (nothing to refresh is honest, not a fabricated row). The hash
  VALUE stays the caller's decision (see deviations).
- **Authority contract, stated per path.** Owner paths run through `withUserTransaction`; the only
  system paths are the due scan and the in-flight claim. No migration change was needed: the `015`
  `recipient_policy_sync_intent_system_access` policy already grants exactly that, and the suite
  asserts a system-context audit append is still REFUSED, so this unit adds no authority it cannot
  demonstrate.

#### TDD Cycle Evidence

| Phase | Evidence |
|---|---|
| RED (module) | Suite written first, run against the absent module: **0 tests run**, `Cannot find module '../../src/wallet/policy/repository.js'`. |
| RED (mutation: the CAS guard) | Removed `AND desired_revision = $3` from `commitAppliedRevision`: the stale-revision case failed (`RECIPIENT_POLICY_STATE_APPLIED_COMPLETE_CK` also fires without the guard, because the stale writer would have left `applied_revision < desired_revision` under an `applied` status). Proves the predicate — not the surrounding test — is what makes a stale write impossible. |
| RED (mutation: conditional consume) | Removed `status='open' AND consumed_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()` from `consumeProposal`: the two-connection race test failed with **two** winners (`expected [ … ] to have a length of 1`). Proves the concurrent proof is a proof, not a serialized coincidence. |
| RED (mutation: the status transition) | Removed `status = 'pending'` from `bumpDesiredRevision`: 2 state cases failed (`expected 'saved_not_configured' to be 'pending'`, and the revision-order/applied-complete CHECK rejecting the bump). Proves the additive constraint from task 1.1 forces the transition and that the test observes it. |
| RED (discovery: the ownership hole) | With the module otherwise green, the new isolation case failed honestly: `promise resolved "'69481c43-…'" instead of rejecting` — `insertIntent` accepted a **foreign** `wallet_id`. RLS's `user_id = app.user_id` check cannot detect that, because the caller trivially satisfies it by naming itself. Fixed with the minimum guard (see deviations 3); the case then passed. |
| GREEN | **19 passed / 19**, stable across 4 consecutive runs. |
| TRIANGULATE | Added after GREEN: the W0 lock is proven exclusive by contending with `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '200ms'` and then succeeding after the holder commits; the CAS re-applies the CURRENT revision (idempotent) while refusing a stale one, so the guard is proven to be the revision rather than "apply once"; `supersedeIntent` is not re-runnable (a terminal row stays terminal); the `(wallet, desired_revision)` index is proven per-wallet by inserting revision 1 for a second wallet; the backoff pair (excluded while `next_attempt_at` is in the future, included again once cleared); "newest active" `signer_grants` is disambiguated with two active rows at explicit ages, so the untouched-row assertions cannot pass by accident. |
| REFACTOR | Three test defects removed after review: a positive control that asserted the wrong relation (the intent's state, not the absent state row), a `WITH CHECK` claim that was actually a `USING` outcome (replaced with a real identity-claiming INSERT), and a truncated doc sentence. No production-code refactor was needed; `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` are clean. |
| False-green guard | Every negative assertion is preceded by a positive control: the owner reads its own state/intent/audit/proposal before the foreign blank is asserted; the owner's W0 lock is released and re-acquired successfully after the timed-out contention; the correct proposal version consumes before the stale one is refused; the owner CAN record intent/audit/proposal for its own wallet before the foreign refusal is asserted; the owner's `signer_grants` refresh writes before the foreign refresh is asserted `null`; `PolicyStateMissingError` is proven reachable on an owned wallet with no state row, so the two error classes are not interchangeable. |
| RLS false-green class | Two test-side instances of the task-1.2 trap were caught and fixed: reading `signer_grants` from a system context returned **zero rows with no error** (owner-isolated table, no system policy), and the fixture now reads it in owner scope with that lesson documented in the helper. |

#### Commands run and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-repository.test.ts` (RED, module absent) | 0 tests, `Cannot find module` |
| `npx vitest run … -t "compare-and-set"` (CAS mutation) | **1 failed** — the stale-revision case |
| `npx vitest run … -t "concurrent"` (consume mutation) | **1 failed** — two consumers both won |
| `npx vitest run … -t "recipient_policy_state"` (bump mutation) | **2 failed** — `'saved_not_configured' ≠ 'pending'` |
| `npx vitest run … -t "refuses to record an intent"` (pre-guard) | **1 failed** — a foreign wallet id was accepted |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-repository.test.ts` | **1 file passed, 19 tests passed** (0.3 s) |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-migration-rls.test.ts tests/integration/recipient-policy-lease.test.ts` | **3 files passed, 34 tests passed** — the 1.1/1.2 suites stayed green |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration/recipient-policy-*.test.ts tests/integration/privy-policy-admin-migration.test.ts` | **5 files passed, 57 tests passed** (includes the real-chain suite that rebuilds a fresh database from `src/db/migrations/`) |
| `npm run lint` | clean (`eslint src tests --max-warnings=0`, exit 0) |
| `npm run typecheck` | clean (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`, exit 0) |
| `npm test` (whole suite, twice) | Pre-existing noise only. **Baseline method:** the same 8 affected files were run with this unit's two new files removed — **5 failures** (`conversation-preview-claim-race:106`, `wallets-sync:198`, `realtime-agent-session:311`, `realtime-tool-binding:183`, `realtime-tools:360`). **With 1.3:** the same 5 by name, plus `notifications-webhook:202`, `api-auth-logout:107`, `api-voice-auth:117`/`:151`, which **pass in isolation on the changed tree (12/12, 5.9 s)** and which differed in count between two consecutive full runs of the same tree (6 then 9) — load/timing flakiness, not a regression. No `recipient-policy-*` suite failed in any state. |
| Identifier/authority audit | No new SQL object, so no identifier-length risk (the 63-char truncation that bit 1.1 only applies to migration identifiers). Authority: the only system-context paths are the intent due scan and claim, both covered by the existing `recipient_policy_sync_intent_system_access`; `recipient_policy_state`, `recipient_policy_audit`, `contact_action_proposals`, `recipients` and `signer_grants` are reached only in owner scope. |

#### Deviations from the design

Four, all deliberate; the first two were forced by the database, the third by a proven hole and the
fourth by an ambiguity the repository must not resolve on its own:

1. **The CAS also writes `applied_recipients`.** §1.5's statement lists the revision guard's columns;
   §2.1 and §5.4 require the verified address union to be persisted so `signer_grants` can be
   refreshed from one authoritative place. The CAS is where verified evidence is committed, so the
   column is written there; §1.5's predicate is unchanged and is still the only guard.
2. **`bumpDesiredRevision` moves the status to `pending` in the same statement.** Forced by task
   1.1's additive `recipient_policy_state_applied_complete_ck`: a bump that left the status at
   `applied` would be a lie the database now refuses. Proven by the third mutation RED, not argued.
   The applied evidence is deliberately NOT cleared here — only a proven divergence destroys it (§4.3).
3. **A wallet-ownership guard (`PolicyWalletNotOwnedError`) on the three writes that name a
   `wallet_id`** (`insertIntent`, `appendPolicyAudit`, `insertProposal` when a wallet is named) plus
   the W0 lock. Row isolation validates `user_id = app.user_id`, which a caller satisfies by naming
   itself, so without this guard a foreign `wallet_id` can be planted inside the caller's own scope.
   Found by the isolation case failing against an otherwise green module; the guard is one indexed
   `SELECT` inside the caller's transaction, so the check and the write cannot be split. No column,
   policy or grant was added — the fix is a predicate, not new authority.
4. **`refreshSignerGrantProjection` takes the hash as a parameter.** §5.4 says `policy_hash` is
   refreshed from the applied rule hash; §0 C6 says `policy_hash` is the consent-envelope hash and
   stays a compatibility field. Both are in the design, so the repository persists the value it is
   given and the choice belongs to the applying transaction (slice 2). The repository deliberately
   does not decide which hash is authoritative.

Two smaller, non-behavioural choices: "newest active" `signer_grants` row is tie-broken
`created_at DESC, id DESC` so the selection is deterministic when two active enrollments share a
timestamp; and `listDueIntents` orders by `next_attempt_at ASC, desired_revision ASC` (matching the
partial due index) with an optional `walletId` filter, which subsumes §5.2's per-wallet
`ORDER BY desired_revision LIMIT 1`.

#### Observations handed to later tasks (not defects in this unit)

- **`recipient_policy_audit` is still owner-only, and the suite asserts it.** A system-context append
  is refused (with the owner-context append as its positive control). Slice 2's `lease_reclaimed`
  append (design §5.2 step 3) must therefore either re-scope to the resolved owner inside its system
  transaction — the established pattern at `src/notifications/reconciliation-worker.ts:199-215` — or
  add an explicit policy AND update that assertion deliberately. It is written as a guard so the
  choice is visible instead of accidental.
- **`claimIntent` is system-scoped and re-claimable by design.** The claim is not the serializer: the
  lease (`W1`) is. Re-claiming a row already in `applying` is idempotent so restart recovery can
  resume a wallet whose holder died.
- **§5.2 step 3 refers to "the intent row's `lease_token`", but §2.2's table has no such column.**
  The in-flight marker is `state`, and the holder is the `recipient_policy_leases` row. Task 2.9 must
  resolve that (read the lease row, not a nonexistent column) — recorded here rather than invented.
- **A new desired revision does not reset `state.next_attempt_at`.** The due scan reads the INTENT's
  `next_attempt_at` (NULL on a fresh insert ⇒ due now), so a stale state-level deadline cannot delay
  a new intent. Task 2.9 decides whether resetting it is wanted.
- **`signer_grants` (and `recipient_policy_state`, `contact_action_proposals`, `recipients`) are
  silently blind to a system context.** The reconciler must resolve the owner from the intent row
  (which it can, thanks to the system-access policy) and then work in owner scope; an anonymous read
  of those tables returns zero rows with no error.
- **Typed conflicts are available for the HTTP contract.** `PolicyIntentIdempotencyConflictError`
  lets task 3.2 implement the `Idempotency-Key` replay without re-querying, and
  `ContactActionProposalConflictError` names the one-window rule for task 4.5.
- **`PolicyWalletNotOwnedError` is a backstop, not the design.** Task 1.6 must keep deriving the
  wallet server-side (§3.5); if the guard ever fires in production, the caller chose the wallet.

#### Remaining tasks in slice 1

```text
- [ ] **1.4 Build the pure composer and prove the composition invariants in unit tests.**
- [ ] **1.5 Implement the readback comparator as a pure function with its failure classes.**
- [ ] **1.6 Add `RecipientPolicyService` with server-owned identity, wallet, and network, plus the strict service-seam types.**
- [ ] **1.7 Implement the atomic removal transaction with whole-grant revocation.**
- [ ] **1.8 Delete the legacy full-rule writer entry points and route their callers through the composer.**
- [ ] **1.9 Document and install the single lock order, prepending `W0` to the claim path.**
- [ ] **1.10 Extend the structural guard suite to make a second full-rule writer unreachable by construction.**
- [ ] **1.11 Run the slice-1 gate and record the slice-1 work-unit commits.**
```

Parent-owned lifecycle rows in `tasks.md` (lines 172–173: the bounded native review and the
post-apply verify/archive) were left byte-for-byte untouched, and no review, receipt or delivery
gate was started by this phase.

#### Workload / PR boundary

One commit, one work unit: `src/wallet/policy/repository.ts` (1 165 lines) plus its integration suite
(1 132 lines) — **~2 300 changed lines**, above the 400-line review budget and reported, not hidden.
It cannot be split further without breaking the unit: the module is one access layer over five tables
whose guarantees (§1.5 CAS, the three intent indexes, exactly-once consume, the authority contract)
are only provable together, and the `gentle-ai-work-unit-commits` rule forbids shrinking the diff by
dropping tests, comments or documentation. It sits inside the parent-assigned `PR 1` slice (tasks
1.1–1.3, rollback boundary "Migration files + `src/wallet/policy/{lease,repository}.ts`"), needs no
migration change, and no `size:exception` is requested. No push, no PR, and no slice-2 work started.

#### Structured status consumed

Native SDD status is non-authoritative for this phase: the parent supplied the resolved work unit, the
authoritative artifact paths and the delivery path directly. Readiness was resolved against the
artifacts before any edit — `tasks.md` (task 1.3, terminal `<!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->`),
`design.md` §1.5/§2.1–§2.5 (and §3.1/§3.5/§4.5/§5.2–§5.4 where they constrain persistence), `spec.md`
and the 1.1/1.2 apply-progress. `actionContext`: all writes stayed inside the assigned worktree root;
the main checkout and the untracked `compose.privy-local.ports.yaml` were not touched.
